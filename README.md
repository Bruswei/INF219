Project description: This is a database-project during our time at University of Bergen. We designed and created a database for our head of department.

Motivation for project: The head of our department has always liked to climb mountains. Therefore he has made a long list of all the mountains he has climbed. The list consisted of over 1300 rows, which made it impractical for furthur use. A database would make it easier and more efficient for inserting and searching mountains. 

Goal: To make it practical for Petter to insert new mountains to his list and create a basis for further development with web resources such as REST.
